            <p>As many of you know, the tracker has been a personal project of mine for almost 2 years. I do it completely free of charge as a way to not only grow as a developer, but also as a way to give back to a community that has become very much a part of my life.</p>
            <p>The tracker application is hosted by <a href="http://digitalocean.com">Digital Ocean</a>, a cloud hosting service that provides load-balancers, snapshots for backup purposes, and a flexible scaling service that grows with the needs of the application. It's not the cheapest service out there, but the pricing points are competitive.</p>
            <p>All proceeds are completely transparent, and any funds donated will go solely toward maintaining the server. I will never charge the AOD community for the ongoing maintainance and development of the Tracker application.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-xs-6">
            <p>Server costs up to this point have come entirely out of my pocket (or Deity's, who graciously covered expenses while it was hosted by NFO). Now, I would like to look to the AOD community for assistance with ensuring the server stays up and running.</p>
            <p>If you find the tools and functionality of the tracker useful, and are willing to contribute, I appreciate any and all assistance. Even if it's just a dollar, your help goes a long way to keeping the lights on.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I will continue to publish the names of individuals who contribute toward the coffers. If you wish to be added to the list, please include your AOD username with your donation (in the comment box).

    <p>Operational costs for the tracker are currently <strong>$15.00 USD</strong> monthly. This includes the droplet, recurring charges for snapshot backups ($0.20 at current size), as well as the deployment service, provided by <a href="http://forge.laravel.com">Laravel Forge</a>
